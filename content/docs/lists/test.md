## 1. TestContainers

[TestContainers](https://testcontainers.com/)

Unit tests with real dependencies

TestContainers is an open source framework for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of
databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker
container.

Test dependencies as code

No more need for mocks or complicated environment configurations. Define your test
dependencies as code, then simply run your tests and containers will be created and then
deleted.

With support for many languages and testing frameworks, all you need is Docker.

Supported languages: python, nodejs, ...

Supported modules: redis, mysql, ...
