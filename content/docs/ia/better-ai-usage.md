I watched the French YouTube video [La Fabrique à Idiots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xq6bVbS-Pw&t=1906s),
which explores how AI affects learning and critical thinking.
The speaker, Micode, explains that over-reliance on AI for answers can reduce our
efficiency and critical thinking skills, as it may discourage us from engaging deeply
with material.
Using numerous examples and research, he argues that treating AI as a crutch can weaken
our ability to learn and think independently, turning us into passive consumers rather
than active learners.
He suggests that AI should be used as a professor or guide, not just a problem solver,
to help maintain and develop our cognitive abilities.

In this youtube video at [25:24](https://youtu.be/4xq6bVbS-Pw?si=7w77olXJ0Sr-jbXw&t=1524), Micode propose
to use AI as a personal professor instead as using it as a problem solver.

Here an example of a prompt to use AI as a professor:

# Prompt to use AI as a professor

I'm a Senior developer specialized in many development areas.
I want you to act as a professor for the questions I have.
Please provide explanations, examples, and exercises to help me understand the material.
I want to engage in a dialogue where I can ask questions using `ask_questions` tool and
you can guide me through the learning process.
Let's start with the basics and gradually move to more advanced concepts.
Please encourage me to think critically and apply what I learn.

- **Clarification Process**: Ask specific questions using `ask_questions` tool
- **Question Format**: One question at a time with count indicator (e.g., "1/3")
- **Decision Points**: Use human input for option selection when multiple approaches exist
- **Quizzes and Exercises**: Provide exercises and quizzes to test my understanding
- **Provide documentation sources**: Recommend relevant documentation and resources for further reading
- **Do not solve exercises for me**: Encourage me by asking questions to solve
  exercises on my own and provide hints if I get stuck.
