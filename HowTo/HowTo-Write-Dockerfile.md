## 1. Dockerfile best practices

Follow [official best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
and you can follow these specific best practices

- But [The worst so-called “best practice” for Docker](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/zecurity-updates-in-docker/),
  explains why you should actually use `apt-get upgrade`
- Use `hadolint`
- Use `;\` to separate each command line
  - some Dockerfiles are using `&&` to separate commands in the same RUN
    instruction (I was doing it too ;-), but I strongly discourage it because
    it breaks the checks done by `set -o errexit`
  - `set -o errexit` makes the whole RUN instruction to fail if one of the
    commands has failed, but it is not the same when using `&&`
- One package by line, packages sorted alphabetically to ease readability
  and merges
- Always specify the most exact version possible of your packages (to avoid
  to get major version that would break your build or software)
- do not usage docker image with latest tag, always specify the right version
  to use

## 2. Basic best practices

### 2.1. Best Practice #1: Merge the image layers

in a Dockerfile each RUN command will create an image layer.

#### 2.1.1. Bad practice #1

Here a bad practice that you shouldn't follow

![avoid layer cache issue](HowTo-Write-Dockerfile-DockerCompose/images/dockerfileLayersBestPractices.png)

#### 2.1.2. Best practice #1

**Best practice #1** merge the RUN layers to avoid cache issue and gain on
total image size

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y apache2 \
    && rm -rf \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
        /tmp/* \
        /var/tmp/* \
        /usr/share/doc/*
```

### 2.2. Best Practice #2: trace commands and fail on error

from previous example we want to trace each command that is executed

#### 2.2.1. Bad practice #2

when building complex layer and one of the command fails,
it's interesting to know which command makes the build to fail

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update \
    && [ -d badFolder ] \
    && apt-get install -y apache2 \
    && rm -rf \
          /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
          /tmp/* \
          /var/tmp/* \
          /usr/share/doc/*
```

`docker build .`  gives the following
[log output(partly truncated)](HowTo-Write-Dockerfile-DockerCompose/badPractice2.log)

Not easy here to know that the command `[ -d badFolder ]` makes the build failing

Without the best practice #2, the following code build successfully

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN set -x ;\
    apt-get update ;\
    [ -d badFolder ] ;\
    ls -al
```

#### 2.2.2. Best Practice #2

**Best Practice #2**: Override SHELL options of the RUN command and
use `;\` instead of `&&`

The following options are set on the shell to override the default behavior:

- `set -o pipefail`: The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the
  last command, unless the pipefail option is enabled.
  - If pipefail is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the
    last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all
    commands exit successfully.
  - without it, a command failure could be masked by the command piped after
    it
- `set -o errexit` (same as `set -e`): Exit immediately if a pipeline (which
   may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command
   (see SHELL GRAMMAR above), exits with a non-zero status.
- `set -o xtrace`(same as `set -x`):  After  expanding  each  simple  command,
   for command, case command, select command, or arithmetic for command,
   display the expanded value of PS4, followed by the command and its expanded
   arguments or associated word list.

Those options are not mandatory but are strongly advised. Although there are
some workaround to know:

- if a command can fail and you want to ignore it, you can use
  - commandThatCanFail || true

**These options can be used with /bin/sh as well.**

Also it is strongly advised to use `;\` to separate commands because it could
happen that some errors are ignored when `&&` is used in conjunction with `||`

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# The SHELL instructions will be applied to all the subsequent RUN instructions
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]
RUN apt-get update ;\
    [ -d  badFolder ] ;\
    apt-get install -y apache2 ;\
    rm -rf \
          /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
          /tmp/* \
          /var/tmp/* \
          /usr/share/doc/*
```

`docker build .`  gives the following
[log output(partly truncated)](HowTo-Write-Dockerfile-DockerCompose/bestPractice2.log)

Here the command line displayed just above the error indicates **clearly**
from where the error comes from:

```log
#5 6.172 + '[' -d badFolder ']'
```

### 2.3. Best practice #3: packages ordering and versions

**Best Practice #3**: order packages alphabetically, always specify packages
versions, ensure non interactive

From previous example we want to install several packages

#### 2.3.1. Bad practice #3

let's add some packages on our previous example (errors removed)

The following docker has the following issues:

- it doesn't set the package versions
- the installation will install also the recommended packages
- it's using apt instead of apt-get (hadolint warning
  [DL3027](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3027)
  Do not use apt as it is meant to be a end-user tool,
  use `apt-get` or `apt-cache` instead)
- the packages are not ordered alphabetically

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]
RUN apt update ;\
    apt install -y php7.4 apache2 php7.4-curl redis-tools ;\
    rm -rf \
          /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
          /tmp/* \
          /var/tmp/* \
          /usr/share/doc/*  
```

#### 2.3.2. Best Practice #3

**Best Practice #3**: order packages alphabetically, always specify packages
versions, ensure non interactive

##### 2.3.2.1. Order packages alphabetically and one package by line

one package by line allows packages to be simpler ordered alphabetically

one package by line and ordering alphabetically allows :

- to merge branches changes more easily
- to detect redundancies more easily
- to improve readability

##### 2.3.2.2. Always specify packages versions

over the time your build's dependencies could be updated on the remote
repositories and your packages be unattended upgraded to the latest version
making your software breaks because it doesn't manage the changes of the new
package.

It happens several times for me, for example, in 2021, xdebug has been
automatically upgraded on one of my docker image from version 2.8 to 3.0 making
all the dev environments broken. It happens also on a build pipeline
with a version of npm gulp that has been upgraded to latest version. In both
cases we resolved the issue by downgrading the version to the one we were
using.

##### 2.3.2.3. Ensure non interactive

some apt-get packages could ask for interactive questions, you can avoid
this using the env variable `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`

**Note:** ARG instruction allows to set env variable available only during
build time

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update ;\
    apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends \
        # Mind to use quotes to avoid shell to try to expand * with some files
        apache2='2.4.*' \
        php7.4='7.4.*' \
        php7.4-curl='7.4.*' \
        # Notice the ':'(colon) 
        redis-tools='5:5.*' \
    ;\
    # cleaning
    apt-get autoremove -y ;\
    apt-get -y clean ;\
    rm -rf \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
        /tmp/* \
        /var/tmp/* \
        /usr/share/doc/*

# use the following command to know the current version of the packages
# using another RUN instead of using previous one will avoid the whole 
# previous layer to be rebuilt
# RUN apt-cache policy \
#         apache2 \
#         php7.4 \
#         php7.4-curl \
#         redis-tools
# Gives the following output
#6 0.387 + apt-cache policy apache2
#6 0.399 apache2:
#6 0.399   Installed: 2.4.41-4ubuntu3.14

#6 0.432         100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
```

### 2.4. Best practice #4: ensure image receives latest security updates

from previous example we want to ensure the image receives the latest security
updates

#### 2.4.1. Bad practice #4

registry image are not always updated and latest apt security updates are not installed

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update ;\
    apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends \
        apache2='2.4.*' \
        php7.4='7.4.*' \
        php7.4-curl='7.4.*' \
        redis-tools='5:5.*' \
    ;\
    # cleaning
    apt-get autoremove -y ;\
    apt-get -y clean ;\
    rm -rf \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
        /tmp/* \
        /var/tmp/* \
        /usr/share/doc/*
```

#### 2.4.2. Best Practice #4

be sure to [apply latest security updates](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/security-updates-in-docker/),
to install the latest security updates in the image, keep sure to
call `apt-get upgrade -y`

Here the updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update ;\
    # be sure to apply latest security updates 
    # https://pythonspeed.com/articles/security-updates-in-docker/
    apt-get upgrade -y ;\
    apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends \
        apache2='2.4.*' \
        php7.4='7.4.*' \
        php7.4-curl='7.4.*' \
        redis-tools='5:5.*' \
    ;\
    # cleaning
    apt-get autoremove -y ;\
    apt-get -y clean ;\
    rm -rf \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
        /tmp/* \
        /var/tmp/* \
        /usr/share/doc/*
```

### 2.5. Conclusion: image size comparison

from previous example we want to ensure the image receives the latest security updates

#### 2.5.1. Dockerfile without best practices

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y apache2 php7.4 php7.4-curl redis-tools
# cleaning
RUN apt-get autoremove -y ;\
    apt-get -y clean ;\
    rm -rf \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
        /tmp/* \
        /var/tmp/* \
        /usr/share/doc/*
```

#### 2.5.2. Dockerfile with all optimizations

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update ;\
    apt-get upgrade -y ;\
    apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends \
        apache2='2.4.*' \
        php7.4='7.4.*' \
        php7.4-curl='7.4.*' \
        redis-tools='5:5.*' \
    ;\
    # cleaning
    apt-get autoremove -y ;\
    apt-get -y clean ;\
    rm -rf \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
        /tmp/* \
        /var/tmp/* \
        /usr/share/doc/*
```

## 3. Docker Buildx best practices

### 3.1. Optimize image size

Source: [https://askubuntu.com/questions/628407/removing-man-pages-on-ubuntu-docker-installation](https://askubuntu.com/questions/628407/removing-man-pages-on-ubuntu-docker-installation)

Let's consider this example

#### 3.1.1. Dockerfile not optimized

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04 as stage1

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]
RUN \
    apt-get update ;\
    apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends \
        htop

FROM stage1 as stage2

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]
RUN \
    # here we just test that the ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND has been inherited from
    # previous stage (it is the case)
    echo "DEBIAN_FRONTEND=${DEBIAN_FRONTEND}"
```

Now let's build and check the image size, the best way to do this is to export
the image to a file

**docker build and save**:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile1 -t test1 . 
docker save test1 -o test1.tar
```

Now we will optimize this image by removing man pages (you can still find man
pages on the web) and removing apt cache

#### 3.1.2. Dockerfile optimized

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04 as stage1

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

COPY 01-noDoc /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/

COPY 02-aptNoCache /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]
RUN \
    # remove apt cache and man/doc
    rm -rf /var/cache/apt/archives /usr/share/{doc,man,locale}/ ;\
    \
    apt-get update ;\
    apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends \
        htop \
    ;\
    # clean apt packages
    apt-get autoremove -y ;\
    ls -al /var/cache/apt ;\
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /usr/share/doc/*

FROM stage1 as stage2

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-o", "errexit", "-o", "xtrace", "-c"]
RUN \
    echo "DEBIAN_FRONTEND=${DEBIAN_FRONTEND}"
```

Here the content of `/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/01-noDoc`, it will tell apt to not
install man docs and translations

```cfg
# /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/01_nodoc

# Delete locales
path-exclude=/usr/share/locale/*

# Delete man pages
path-exclude=/usr/share/man/*

# Delete docs
path-exclude=/usr/share/doc/*
path-include=/usr/share/doc/*/copyright
```

Here the content of `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02-aptNoCache`, it will instruct apt
to not store any cache (note that apt-get clean will not work after that change
but you don't need to use it anymore)

```cfg
Dir::Cache "";
Dir::Cache::archives "";
```

Now let's build and check the image size, the best way to do this is to export
the image to a file

**docker build and save**:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile2 -t test2 . 
docker save test2 -o test2.tar
```

Here the size of the files

```text
test1.tar 117 020 672 bytes
test2.tar  76 560 896 bytes
```

We passed from ~117MB to ~76MB so we gain ~41MB  
Please note also that we used `--no-install-recommends` option in both example
that allows us to save some other MB
