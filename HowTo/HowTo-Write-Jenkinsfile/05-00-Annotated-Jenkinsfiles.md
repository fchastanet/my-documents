# Annotated Jenkinsfiles

[Pipeline example](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/#pipeline-example)

## Simple one

This build is used to generate docker images used to build production code and
launch phpunit tests. This pipeline is parameterized in the Jenkins UI directly
with the parameters:

- branch (git branch to use)
- environment(select with 3 options: build, phpunit or all)
  - it would have been better to use simply 2 checkboxes phpunit/build
- project_branch

Here the source code with inline comments:

// This method allows to convert the branch name to a docker image tag.

without seeing the Dockerfile files, we can advise :

- to build these images in the same pipeline where build and phpunit are run
  - the images are built at the same time so we are sure that we are using the
    right version
- apparently the docker build depend on the branch of the project, this should
  be avoided
- ssh key is used in docker image, that could lead to a **security issue** as
  ssh key is still in the history of images layers even if it has been removed
  in subsequent layers, check <https://stackoverflow.com/a/66897280> for
  information on how to use ssh-agent instead
- we could use a single Dockerfile with 2 stages:
  - one stage to generate production image
  - one stage that inherits production stage, used to execute phpunit
  - it has the following advantages :
    - reduce the total image size because of the reuse different docker image
      layers
    - only one Dockerfile to maintain
