### TestContainers

[TestContainers](https://testcontainers.com/)

Unit tests with real dependencies

TestContainers is an open source framework for providing throwaway, lightweight
instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything
that can run in a Docker container.

Test dependencies as code

No more need for mocks or complicated environment configurations. Define your
test dependencies as code, then simply run your tests and containers will be
created and then deleted.

With support for many languages and testing frameworks, all you need is Docker.

Supported languages: python, nodejs, ...

Supported modules: redis, mysql, ...
